# Gesture Controlled Robot Car
 It is a robot car which moves based on the hand gestures the human controller makes. The human controller will have a wireless controller on his hand and the gestures of his hands will be detected by this controller using an accelerometer sensor and proper control signals will be transmitted wirelessly to the robot car via nRF modules.
