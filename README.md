# Gesture Controlled Robot Car
 It is a robot car which moves based on the hand gestures the human controller makes. The human controller will have a wireless controller on his/her hand and the gestures of his/her hand will be detected by this controller using an accelerometer sensor and proper control signals will be transmitted wirelessly to the robot car via nRF transmitter and receiver modules.
